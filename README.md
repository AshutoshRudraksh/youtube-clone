## üì¶ Part 2: Video Processing Service

### Project Initialization

1. **Create a Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir video-processing-service
   cd video-processing-service

2. **Initialize Node.js Project**:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node
   npm install --save-dev @types/node @types/express
   npm install @google-cloud/storage


üìù Notes
Version Control:
Commit package.json to your version control system.
Add node_modules to .gitignore to exclude it from version control.
Middleware:
Ensure app.use(express.json()) is included to parse JSON request bodies.
Port Conflicts:
If port 3000 is in use, identify and terminate the conflicting process before starting the server.
By following this guide, you'll set up a robust video processing service as part of the YouTube Clone project. Happy coding! üéâ
